## Proposal
### What problem does your app solve?
* Tracking hours because most wilderness guides are independent contractors
### How does your app solve this problem?
* A central system where we can view our trips and other trips
* Ability for guides to market themselves and what they have done
* Allows people to find guides in their area
### What is the mission statement
_Guidr is a platform that helps backcountry guides of all types log their private/professional trips. Guides are able to use Guidr to build their Outdoor Resume, track the hours and income they have accumulated, find potential clients, and network with other guides. Guides can login, create read, and update their trips with a trip type, location, duration and whether it's private or professional._
